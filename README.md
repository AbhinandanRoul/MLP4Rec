## MLP4Rec: A Pure MLP Architecture for Sequential Recommendations (IJCAI 2022, Long Oral)

This repo contains a copy of RecBole 1.0.1, with our implementation of MLP4Rec

Current release is our prelimnary version, which suffers from some efficiency issues, we are currently collaborating with RecBole to solve those issues

## Usage

Before running MLP4Rec, please make sure you visit https://recbole.io/ and https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole first to make sure that you have fulfilled the pre-requistes and familar with basic RecBole usage.

Then, you can simply running run_mlp4rec.py from root directory, default dataset is ml-100k, experiment configurations is by default sync with ours https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/297.
