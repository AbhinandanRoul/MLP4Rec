## MLP4Rec: A Pure MLP Architecture for Sequential Recommendations (IJCAI 2022, Long Oral)

This repo contains a copy of RecBole 1.0.1, with our implementation of MLP4Rec

Current release is our prelimnary version, which suffers from some efficiency issues, we are currently collaborating with RecBole to solve those issues

## Usage

Before running MLP4Rec, please make sure you visit https://recbole.io/ and https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole first to make sure that you have fulfilled the pre-requistes and familar with basic RecBole usage.

Then, you can simply running run_mlp4rec.py from root directory, default dataset is ml-100k, experiment configurations is by default sync with ours https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/297.

Note that for efficiency concern, we use Automatic Mixed Precision Training (AMP) by default

## Report a problem

If you encounter any problem, please contact Muyang Li by muli0371@uni.sydney.edu.au

## Paper replication note:

Additionally, run run_mlp4rec_beauty.py to train and evaluate on the beauty dataset. The beauty dataset can be downloaded from: https://recbole.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/ProcessedDatasets/Amazon_ratings/Amazon_Beauty.zip.
